This is a general JS test, you can just log results to the console.*
Given an array of inputs (location name, postal code), log the current time and weather for those locations.

Example: "./weather New York, 10005, Tokyo, SÃ£o Paulo, Pluto"

Follow our Code guidelines (see at very bottom)
You should use JavaScript, TypeScript is a plus.
The code should be self-documenting, although you can use comments to convey the reason for your design decisions.
Make sure you commit your progress in a sensible way, if you're doing TDD you should start with tests.

You'll be evaluated on:
- Code consistency and naming conventions
- Use of reactive/functional paradigm
- Code abstraction
- Error Handling
- Testing
- Git commiting

When you're done, push your code to a GitHub repo and share the link
